# MemOS
Marcus Izumi, Evan Liu

A very simple operating system that probes the system memory and reports back the available memory by printing to the screen. Written for [Richard West](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/richwest/)'s CS552 class. 

There are two versions, ```memos-1``` probes the machine's memory in Real-Mode using BIOS interrupts while ```memos-2``` probes in Protected-Mode with help from GRUB for the memory mapping.
